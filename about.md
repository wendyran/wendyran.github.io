My name is Ran Wei and I'm currently a Ph.D. student at [the Ohio State University](http://www.stat.osu.edu), majoring in Statistics and minoring in Computer Science. My advisors are [Dr. Elizabeth Stasny](http://www.stat.osu.edu/people/faculty#stasny) and [Dr. David Sivakoff](http://www.stat.osu.edu/~dsivakoff/index/Home.html). I also got lots of valuble advice and support from Dr. Tao Shi for my Ph.D. study. 
 
Before I came to the U.S., I got my bechelor's degree in statistics from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english), China. My research interests land on the general area of social networks analysis, specifically network sampling inferences. My enthusiasm goes for using machine learning techniques to explore, understand and predict.My tech hobbies include torturing data (untill it confesses), solving programming challenges and playing with maths. 

I have worked as a research associate in the [Campus Transit Lab](http://transitlab.osu.edu/campus-transit-lab) for one year and as a consultant at the OSU [Statistical Consulting Service](http://www.scs.osu.edu/) for two years. I have interned as a Data Scientist at two social networks companies: [Manta](http://www.manta.com/) (Summer 2013) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wendyranstat) (Summer 2014). I'm going back to Twitter as a Software Engineering Intern during Summer 2015. 

My hobby includes solving [data science challenges](https://www.kaggle.com/). I'm one of the [team members](https://www.stat.osu.edu/node/1469) who won the 2013 [Capital One Student Modeling Competition](http://artsandsciences.osu.edu/news/statistics-graduate-students-win-national-data-analyticsmodeling-competition), the task of which includes recommending merchants to each customer.
