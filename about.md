My name is Ran Wei and I'm currently a Ph.D. student at [the Ohio State University](http://www.stat.osu.edu), majoring in Statistics and minoring in Computer Science. Before I came to the U.S., I got my bechelor's degree in statistics from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english), China. My research interests land on the general area of social networks analysis, specifically network sampling inferences. My enthusiasm goes for using machine learning techniques to explore, understand and predict. My tech hobbies include torturing data (untill it confesses), solving programming challenges and playing with maths.
