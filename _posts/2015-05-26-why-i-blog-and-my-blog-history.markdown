I started my first personal blog using [MSN Space][MSN Space] (or Windows Live Spaces) during 2006 summer when I graduated from high school and before I went to Zhejiang University for my undergraduate. The MSN Space is where I kept a record of my thoughts after the stressful high school and before I entered my colorful college life. Since then, like many others, I've written in several different blogs: [ycool][ycool](previously 'yculblog'; Chinese name: 歪酷), [sina blog][sina blog], [baidu space][baidu space] (closed on May 7th, 2015) and [wordpress][wordpress]. 

[MSN Space]: 	http://spaces.live.com
[ycool]:		http://www.ycool.com 
[sina blog]: 	http://blog.sina.com
[baidu space]:  http://hi.baidu.com
